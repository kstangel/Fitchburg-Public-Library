<h1>Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.</h1>
<p>Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. is the world leader in serving science. Our mission is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. With revenues of nearly $11 billion, we have approximately 37,000 employees and serve customers within pharmaceutical and biotech companies, hospitals and clinical diagnostic labs, universities, research institutions and government agencies, as well as in environmental and process control industries. We create value for our key stakeholders through two premier brands, Thermo Scientific and Fisher Scientific, which offer a unique combination of continuous technology development and the most convenient purchasing options. Our products and services help accelerate the pace of scientific discovery, and solve analytical challenges ranging from complex research to routine testing to field applications. </p><p>

At our Fitchburg Wisconsin facility, over 400 employees are committed to the design, manufacturing, marketing and servicing of our spectroscopy and microanalysis products. These analytical instruments are used across education, industry and research institutions to identify material characteristics. Applications range from identifying hazardous material in children’s toys to confirming the quality and authenticity of a pharmaceutical drug. 
</p><p>
Sustainability is a corporate policy.  From companywide practices such as recycling, reducing hazardous waste, conserving energy and employee based “go green” initiatives, to green packaging, reusable containers and LEED compliant lab furniture and fume hoods, all practices, policies and production work to protect the world in which we live.  
</p><p>
Our corporate charitable efforts focus in two main areas:  the advancement of science and technology and giving back to our communities.  In Fitchburg, we have contributed to the library project through our corporate sponsorship of the Community Meeting Room.  Thermo Fisher Scientific employees have also volunteered to help shelve the new library’s collection and will continue to volunteer their time, expertise and resources to support science related activities at the library.

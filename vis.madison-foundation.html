<h1>Madison Community Foundation</h1>
<p>
The Board of Governors of Madison Community Foundation believes that support for public libraries is one of the most powerful of philanthropic initiatives, and is proud to be part of the effort to build a new library for the residents of the City of Fitchburg. A library acts as a social, cultural, and educational hub of a community, creating opportunities for collaboration, exploration, and life-long learning. This is high-impact philanthropy at its finest.</p>
<p>
Madison Community Foundation has a long tradition of funding libraries through grants to capital campaigns, facilitation of gifts, creation of a library collections grant program and help in building and managing over 20 library funds. 
</p>
<p>
Established in 1942, the mission of the Madison Community Foundation is to encourage, facilitate and manage long-term philanthropy. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, MCF awards grants and scholarships from many endowed funds to nonprofit organizations throughout Dane County and beyond. MCF provides donors with a simple, convenient and flexible way to make a positive difference now and far into the future.</p>
<p>
Congratulations to the City of Fitchburg, Friends of the Library and all of the generous and determined citizens who helped make the Fitchburg Public Library dream come true.</p>

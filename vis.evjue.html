<h1>The Evjue Foundation</h1>
<p>The Evjue Foundation, Inc. is the charitable arm of The Capital Times, a progressive voice for news, information and opinion for more than 94 years. William T. Evjue founded the paper in 1917 to ensure that those without the power of wealth and station would have a champion in the quest for clean and just government.</p>
<p>
Mr. Evjue started The Evjue Foundation a few years before his death. During those years he contributed a few thousand dollars to the handful of causes that commanded his attention. When he died in 1970, his will directed that all proceeds from the controlling voting stock that he owned in The Capital Times Co. be turned over to the Foundation that he had formed a few years before. That money, he directed, must go to organizations that best exemplify the beliefs that he championed during his lifetime, causes that could improve the quality of life for all the people in the Dane County area. That few thousand dollars of the early years has grown into millions today.
</p>
<p>
The Evjue Foundation provides funds derived from the profits of The Capital Times to many educational, cultural, and charitable causes that add much to the quality of life in Madison and Dane County.</p>
<p>
The Foundation has been able to help everyone from fledgling organizations that promote theater to large organizations that feed the hungry, from small community groups that work with troubled youngsters to large institutions such as the University of Wisconsin.</p>
